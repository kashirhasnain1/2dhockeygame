        <center><h1>Executive Summary:</h1></center>
<h2>
    Game Concept:
</h2>
<p>
    There are 4 types of plenties in hockey
    <ol>
        <li>Plenty Corner</li>
        <li>Short Corner/Long Corner</li>
        <li>Plenty Stroke</li>
        <li>Plenty Shootout</li>
        </ol>
    This game was play on Grassy Field.I will made this for practice Purpose. When a game start and it shows the above and user has choice to practice any one of the above. There is one referee player and a goal keeper with his necessary assets such as hockey stick, white ball as player and goalkeeper with his suite. The user will act as goalkeepers or player in most of the scenario. When a user score a point the audio will be generate (produce) on behalf of user and if computer stops from scoring the audio will be converted into silence with some volume for Computer. This kind of idea (audio) will boost the user stamina boost up and user will know the points where maximum user try their ball direction.    The stroke rate will be displayed on the screen and it will be played on window using mouse input drag and drop and the direction meter will be shown and it will be adjusted by user and camera is 180 degree moving means the full goal is shown and the user will be shown in the video game.

    Further the more mode will be made. The idea was basically to make only a Semester Project.Thats why idea will be short.
    Movement is the basic phenomea where the game full concept is based.
